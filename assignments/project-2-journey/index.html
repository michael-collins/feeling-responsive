Project theme: “Journey”

For this project, you will produce an animation centered around the theme, “journey.” Consider a future where the global supply chain is permanently disrupted and the potential impact this scenario could have on goods and services. What are some examples journeys that you might want to embark upon, or perhaps would like others to experience? What journeys do objects and things undergo that might not be perceivable by most people? What is the purpose of these journeys? What new aesthetics might emerge or be discovered that could communicate these ideas, feelings, and contemplations?

To focus your research and concept development, you can optionally choose a sub-theme:


  A short trip
  Atmospheric adventure
  Explainer
  Growth, change, and transformation
  Invisible systems


For this the project,  you will design, model, texture, animate, and render a 30 second animation solving for the project theme. Once you have a project idea and storyboard created, locate sound that you find on the audio resources tab that is licensed for remix (CC or Public Domain). Pay special attention to the audio track’s licensing. You cannot use anything that states no derivatives, indicated by “ND” in the license. If the license requires you to give credit (CC-BY), you can give credit in the Vimeo.com description (where you will be uploading your video). You are encouraged to edit, modify, and combine different audio tracks to suit the needs of your animation.

You will also critically reflect on your work and the project theme in a 150 word work statement.

A successful project will demonstrate understanding and mastery of 3D tools and processes, application of formal design principles, attention to detail and composition, and lead to discussion about your work during a critique.

Project format

Choose a format that you can reasonable accomplish within the timeframe of the project. Examples include:


  Narrative short film (character animation)
  Motion graphics for branding and identity
  Explainer animation
  VJ loops for live performances
  Experimental or non-narrative content: Examples on vimeo.com
  Scientific or data-driven simulations and visualizations
  Projection mapping (projecting video onto structures or surfaces).


The video should contain 30 seconds of animation ±5 seconds. While this may not seem like a very long time for an animation, it’s actually quite a lot of work to make 30 well crafted and polished seconds in terms of animation, modeling and materials, and rendering quality.

Production Process (All steps required)

Week 1: Pre-production


  Concept(s):
    
      Resources
        
          What makes for a good concept: Concept Definition, Concept Formation, Design Concept Thoughts
        
      
      Requirements:
        
          3 to 5 different written ideas.
          Sound clip from freemusicarchive.org or other sources.
          Visual reference sheet(s): Example of visual reference sheet.
          Note: Develop the concept around your interests. Are you interested in fashion or video game environments? Great, solve the theme around your interests!
        
      
    
  
  Storyboard
    
      Resources
        
          Template download: storyboard-template.pdf

          .txt file with link to Vimeo.com
        
      
    
  


Writing a work statement

A work statement is a clear articulation about what you’ve made. This is not a journal entry, where you might feel compelled to complain about problems you’ve had with software, or that it didn’t turn out how you wanted. Instead, imagine this is being printed in a magazine, or put on the side of a gallery. What do you want your viewers to come away with?

Example projects with work and artist statements:


  geist.xyz by Zeitguised
  Mushtari by Neri Oxman
  Institute for New Feeling by Nina Sarnelle


Include the following to create a clear work statement:


  Your name and date
  Title of your work
  What did you create?
    
      IE - “I created an animation that depict …”
    
  
  Why did you make it?
    
      IE - “I created this work because I am interested in exploring …”
    
  
  What is the work about?
    
      IE - “This work is primarily focused on …”
    
  
  How is what you did in your work demonstrating what what you’ve said the work is about?
    
      IE - “You can see an example of this in the work where I have used … to reference …”
    
  
  OPTIONAL: Were there any unexpected, interesting, or strange outcomes?
  OPTIONAL: Did you have any interesting moments where the projects theme helped you understand something new or from a new perspective?


Constraints

Do not produce work that could be construed as ‘fan art’ for existing intellectual properties. All assets used in the production of the work must be created by you, be appropriately licensed for use, or be appropriated in a transformative way that significantly alters the nature of the original asset. For example, you can use a texture pack you downloaded from a texture website, however, if you render an image of just a flat plane with the texture applied, this is not really creative transformation since the entirety of the image is work from someone else. Your transformation and contextualization is what’s important. A render with a background that uses an image from Google image search (please don’t do this) that comprises more than 50% of the work is also not really enough creative transformation. If someone reviews your work and says that the image’s background is their favorite part of the image, you’ll have to then explain how you didn’t make the background, which is not a great situation to be in.">

        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p><strong>Project theme:</strong> “Journey”</p>

<p>For this project, you will produce an animation centered around the theme, <strong>“journey.”</strong> Consider a future where the global supply chain is permanently disrupted and the potential impact this scenario could have on goods and services. What are some examples journeys that you might want to embark upon, or perhaps would like others to experience? What journeys do objects and things undergo that might not be perceivable by most people? What is the purpose of these journeys? What new aesthetics might emerge or be discovered that could communicate these ideas, feelings, and contemplations?</p>

<p>To focus your research and concept development, you can optionally choose a <strong>sub-theme</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://alexanderperrin.com.au/paper/shorttrip/">A short trip</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QiC8pNfYl4">Atmospheric adventure</a></li>
  <li>Explainer</li>
  <li>Growth, change, and transformation</li>
  <li>Invisible systems</li>
</ul>

<p>For this the project,  you will design, model, texture, animate, and render a <strong>30 second animation</strong> solving for the project theme. Once you have a project idea and storyboard created, locate sound that you find on the audio resources tab that is licensed for remix (CC or Public Domain). Pay special attention to the <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/Video/blog/Not_All_Music_on_FMA_is_Licensed_for_Video">audio track’s licensing</a>. You cannot use anything that states no derivatives, indicated by “ND” in the license. If the license requires you to give credit (CC-BY), you can give credit in the Vimeo.com description (where you will be uploading your video). You are encouraged to edit, modify, and combine different audio tracks to suit the needs of your animation.</p>

<p>You will also critically reflect on your work and the project theme in a 150 word work statement.</p>

<p>A successful project will demonstrate understanding and mastery of 3D tools and processes, application of <a href="https://www.getty.edu/education/teachers/building_lessons/principles_design.pdf">formal design principles</a>, attention to detail and composition, and lead to discussion about your work during a critique.</p>

<h3 id="project-format">Project format</h3>

<p>Choose a format that you can reasonable accomplish within the timeframe of the project. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Narrative short film (character animation)</li>
  <li>Motion graphics for branding and identity</li>
  <li>Explainer animation</li>
  <li>VJ loops for live performances</li>
  <li>Experimental or non-narrative content: <a href="https://vimeo.com/categories/experimental">Examples on vimeo.com</a></li>
  <li>Scientific or data-driven simulations and visualizations</li>
  <li>Projection mapping (projecting video onto structures or surfaces).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The video should contain 30 seconds of animation ±5 seconds.</strong> While this may not seem like a very long time for an animation, it’s actually quite a lot of work to make 30 well crafted and polished seconds in terms of animation, modeling and materials, and rendering quality.</p>

<h3 id="writing-a-work-statement">Writing a work statement</h3>

<p>A work statement is a clear articulation about what you’ve made. This is not a journal entry, where you might feel compelled to complain about problems you’ve had with software, or that it didn’t turn out how you wanted. Instead, imagine this is being printed in a magazine, or put on the side of a gallery. What do you want your viewers to come away with?</p>

<p><strong>Example projects with work and artist statements:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://vimeo.com/150824660">geist.xyz</a> by Zeitguised</li>
  <li><a href="https://neri.media.mit.edu/projects/details/mushtari.html">Mushtari</a> by Neri Oxman</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.maakemagazine.com/nina-sarnelle">Institute for New Feeling</a> by Nina Sarnelle</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Include the following to create a clear work statement:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Your name and date</li>
  <li>Title of your work</li>
  <li>What did you create?
    <ul>
      <li>IE - “I created an animation that depict …”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why did you make it?
    <ul>
      <li>IE - “I created this work because I am interested in exploring …”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is the work about?
    <ul>
      <li>IE - “This work is primarily focused on …”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How is what you did in your work demonstrating what what you’ve said the work is about?
    <ul>
      <li>IE - “You can see an example of this in the work where I have used … to reference …”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>OPTIONAL: Were there any unexpected, interesting, or strange outcomes?</li>
  <li>OPTIONAL: Did you have any interesting moments where the projects theme helped you understand something new or from a new perspective?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="constraints">Constraints</h3>

<p>Do not produce work that could be construed as ‘fan art’ for existing intellectual properties. All assets used in the production of the work must be created by you, be appropriately licensed for use, or be appropriated in a transformative way that significantly alters the nature of the original asset. For example, you can use a texture pack you downloaded from a texture website, however, if you render an image of just a flat plane with the texture applied, this is not really creative transformation since the entirety of the image is work from someone else. Your transformation and contextualization is what’s important. A render with a background that uses an image from Google image search (please don’t do this) that comprises more than 50% of the work is also not really enough creative transformation. If someone reviews your work and says that the image’s background is their favorite part of the image, you’ll have to then explain how you didn’t make the background, which is not a great situation to be in.</p>
