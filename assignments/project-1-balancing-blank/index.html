Project theme: “Balancing __”

Balance is both a verb and a noun, it’s something that can be possessed, taken away, created, and dismantled. You hear about balance in sports, politics, wellness, work, personal life, relationships, religion/spirituality, and as a core formal design principle. How do you know when something is not in balance? Can balance something that is exciting when it’s gone? Is a lack of balance damaging or constructive? Can demonstrating balance help tell a story or explain a principle?

For this project, you will complete the project theme by choosing an emphasis word and filling in the blank. For instance, if you choose the word stone as your emphasis word, you would write “Balancing stone” and use this word pair as the project theme. Apply a creative development process to create an image or images that convey your ideas. You will need to choose a project format that corresponds with your media interests, participate in peer reviews, and follow the weekly production process. You will critically reflect on the work you have created and the project theme in a 150 word work statement.

A successful project will demonstrate understanding and mastery of 3D tools and processes, application of formal design principles, attention to detail and composition, and lead to discussion about your work during a critique.

Project formats (Choose one)

Choose a format that you can reasonable accomplish within the timeframe of the project. Do not use motion or animation in the final output.


  High resolution image(s). These images are large enough to allow a viewer to spend time looking closely, enticing them to explore discover details.
  3D Style frames for pitching larger projects (animations, product, illustration, etc.)
  Poster design (follows a particular poster size format)
  Magazine or book illustration (choose a magazine or book)
  Comic book pages/panels
  Political cartoon
  Realtime display on Sketchfab.com or p3d.in websites.
  Modular game assets (with examples of the things they can construct)
  Archiviz Renderings of interior or exterior spaces
  Renderings in the style of portrait photography
  Renderings in the style of a particular style of photography, painting, or illustration.
  Product design concept renderings
  Renderings of experimental forms and surfaces, materials and textures, light and colors.
  Character design concept art or
  Other (talk with instructor about an idea not listed)


Production Process (All steps required)

Week 1: Concept development

What makes for a good concept: Concept Definition, Concept Formation, Design Concept Thoughts.


  Concept(s): Sketch, label, and write ideas in sketchbook.
    
      Fill 3 to 5 pages of your sketchbook with project ideas. You may also work digitally if you prefer an all digital workflow, in which case, sketch the equivalent of 3 to 5 pages of a paper sketchbook.
      Upload jpg or png images of sketchbook pages
      Must be clearly scanned or photographed. This should look professional, do not upload blurry, rotated, poorly cropped images.
      If you used the concept development worksheet linked in the assignment rather than a sketchbook, you may submit scans or well cropped photos of the concept development worksheet page, or upload a pdf file.
      Note: Develop the concept around your interests. Are you interested in fashion or video game environments? Great, solve the theme around your interests!
    
  
  Mood board or reference sheet: Find reference images and put them into a large image canvas. See example of mood board. Save as a single image.
    
      You can use Photoshop, PureRef or Mural.co
      Submit as a png or jpg
    
  
  Work intent: Describe what you will be doing
    
      Include name, date, and project format
      Write a few sentences to describe what you intend to make.
      Upload this in an MS Word doc format
    
  


Week 2: Production begins


  Submit screenshots from Blender showing significant progress.
  Post your screenshots to the Project 1: Progress 1 screenshots discussion thread
  Meet with instructor if needed


Week 3: Production continues


  Submit screenshots from Blender showing significant progress
  Submit a draft of your 150 word minimum work statement
  Participate in peer reviews for statement drafts
  Post your screenshots to the Project 1: Progress 2 screenshots discussion thread
  Meet with instructor if needed


Week 4: Finish production and present work


  Upload final materials as a LASTNAME-project1-files.zip file
    
      Include final work statement
        
          MS Word .doc format
          150 words minimum
          file name: LASTNAME-project1-statement.doc
        
      
      Include the media (finished renders) you created
    
  
  Post your finished renders to the Project: 1 submission images show and tell discussion thread
  Participate in work critique with peers


Week 5: (Optional)


  If all work was completed and submitted on time, you may submit work revisions based on peer and instructor feedback. This is not required.


Writing a work statement

A work statement is a clear articulation about what you’ve made, why you have made it, and how it connects to the project theme. This is not a journal entry, where you might feel compelled to complain about problems you’ve had with software, or that it didn’t turn out how you wanted. Instead, imagine this is being printed in a magazine, or put on the side of a gallery. What do you want your viewers to come away with?

Example projects with work and artist statements:


  geist.xyz by Zeitguised
  Mushtari by Neri Oxman
  Institute for New Feeling by Nina Sarnelle


Include the following to create a clear work statement:


  Your name and date
  Title of your work
  What did you create?
    
      IE - “I created images that depict …”
    
  
  Why did you make it?
    
      IE - “I created this work because I am interested in exploring …”
    
  
  What is the work about?
    
      IE - “This work is primarily focused on …”
    
  
  How is what you did in your work demonstrating what what you’ve said the work is about?
    
      IE - “You can see an example of this in the work where I have used … to reference …”
    
  
  Were there any unexpected, interesting, or strange outcomes?
  Did you have any interesting moments where the projects theme helped you understand something new or from a new perspective?


Constraints

All assets used in the production of the work must be created by you, be appropriately licensed for use, or be appropriated in a transformative way that significantly alters the nature of the original asset. For example, you can use a texture pack you downloaded from a texture website, however, if you render an image of just a flat plane with the texture applied, this is not really creative transformation since the entirety of the image is work from someone else. Your transformation and contextualization is what’s important. A render with a background that uses an image from Google image search (please don’t do this) that comprises more than 50% of the work is also not really enough creative transformation. If someone reviews your work and says that the image’s background is their favorite part of the image, you’ll have to then explain how you didn’t make the background, which is not a great situation to be in.

Frequently asked questions

Q: I’m having trouble coming up with a project concept. What do I do?

A: Don’t panic, this is the hardest thing there is beyond learning technical production skills. First, look through the “inspiration” links to see what other artists and designers are doing. If that doesn’t spark any ideas, download and try the concept development worksheet. Many people are able to generate ideas from this worksheet. If the worksheet isn’t helping you come up with any ideas that you are interested in, the third recommendation I have is to use your environment to generate ideas for you. Through observation, ideas can come to you. To do this, write down everything you see, think and feel, and apply a filtering process to establish relationships between those things. This is part of a design thinking process, and there are many design thinking processes to choose from. How you develop your concept doesn’t matter, and the concept itself doesn’t matter. The important thing is that you are going through some kind of creative or generative process to articulate a concept, and can then respond to it by creating creative works. I often find that listening to other artists and designers talk about their process inspires my own. Often, the stranger the process, the more interesting the work is.

        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p><strong>Project theme:</strong> “Balancing <em>__</em>”</p>

<p>Balance is both a verb and a noun, it’s something that can be possessed, taken away, created, and dismantled. You hear about balance in sports, politics, wellness, work, personal life, relationships, religion/spirituality, and as a core formal design principle. How do you know when something is not in balance? Can balance something that is exciting when it’s gone? Is a lack of balance damaging or constructive? Can demonstrating balance help tell a story or explain a principle?</p>

<p>For this project, you will complete the project theme by choosing an emphasis word and filling in the blank. For instance, if you choose the word <strong><em>stone</em></strong> as your emphasis word, you would write “Balancing stone” and use this word pair as the project theme. Apply a creative development process to create an image or images that convey your ideas. You will need to choose a project format that corresponds with your media interests, participate in peer reviews, and follow the weekly production process. You will critically reflect on the work you have created and the project theme in a 150 word work statement.</p>

<p>A successful project will demonstrate understanding and mastery of 3D tools and processes, application of <a href="https://www.incredibleart.org/lessons/rhodes/designprinciples.html">formal design principles</a>, attention to detail and composition, and lead to discussion about your work during a critique.</p>

<h3 id="writing-a-work-statement">Writing a work statement</h3>

<p>A work statement is a clear articulation about what you’ve made, why you have made it, and how it connects to the project theme. This is not a journal entry, where you might feel compelled to complain about problems you’ve had with software, or that it didn’t turn out how you wanted. Instead, imagine this is being printed in a magazine, or put on the side of a gallery. What do you want your viewers to come away with?</p>

<p><strong>Example projects with work and artist statements:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://vimeo.com/150824660">geist.xyz</a> by Zeitguised</li>
  <li><a href="https://neri.media.mit.edu/projects/details/mushtari.html">Mushtari</a> by Neri Oxman</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.maakemagazine.com/nina-sarnelle">Institute for New Feeling</a> by Nina Sarnelle</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Include the following to create a clear work statement:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Your name and date</li>
  <li>Title of your work</li>
  <li>What did you create?
    <ul>
      <li>IE - “I created images that depict …”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why did you make it?
    <ul>
      <li>IE - “I created this work because I am interested in exploring …”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is the work about?
    <ul>
      <li>IE - “This work is primarily focused on …”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How is what you did in your work demonstrating what what you’ve said the work is about?
    <ul>
      <li>IE - “You can see an example of this in the work where I have used … to reference …”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Were there any unexpected, interesting, or strange outcomes?</li>
  <li>Did you have any interesting moments where the projects theme helped you understand something new or from a new perspective?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="constraints">Constraints</h3>

<p>All assets used in the production of the work must be created by you, be appropriately licensed for use, or be appropriated in a transformative way that significantly alters the nature of the original asset. For example, you can use a texture pack you downloaded from a texture website, however, if you render an image of just a flat plane with the texture applied, this is not really creative transformation since the entirety of the image is work from someone else. Your transformation and contextualization is what’s important. A render with a background that uses an image from Google image search (please don’t do this) that comprises more than 50% of the work is also not really enough creative transformation. If someone reviews your work and says that the image’s background is their favorite part of the image, you’ll have to then explain how you didn’t make the background, which is not a great situation to be in.</p>

<h3 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently asked questions</h3>

<p><strong>Q: I’m having trouble coming up with a project concept. What do I do?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Don’t panic, this is the hardest thing there is beyond learning technical production skills. First, look through the “inspiration” links to see what other artists and designers are doing. If that doesn’t spark any ideas, download and try the concept development worksheet. Many people are able to generate ideas from this worksheet. If the worksheet isn’t helping you come up with any ideas that you are interested in, the third recommendation I have is to use your environment to generate ideas for you. Through observation, ideas can come to you. To do this, write down everything you see, think and feel, and apply a filtering process to establish relationships between those things. This is part of a design thinking process, and there are many design thinking processes to choose from. <em>How</em> you develop your concept doesn’t matter, and <em>the concept</em> itself doesn’t matter. The important thing is that you are going through some kind of creative or generative process to articulate a concept, and can then respond to it by creating creative works. I often find that listening to other artists and designers talk about their process inspires my own. Often, the stranger the process, the more interesting the work is.</p>
