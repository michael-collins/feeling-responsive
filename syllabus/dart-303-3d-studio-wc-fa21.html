Description

Undergraduate Bulletin

Equipment and materials


  Given many students are learning remotely, a reliable and relatively well-spec’d computer is ideal for this course.
  Optional but recommended: Standalone digital tablet similar to the Wacom Intuos Pro for drawing and painting.
  Sketchbook


Accounts and access

Your PSU account allows you to access: box.psu.edu, lynda.psu.edu, canvas.psu.edu, and Zoom. You will also need to visit Google owned websites such as youtube and Google Drive. If you are in a country that doesn’t have have access to the free and open Internet, you can try using the Penn State VPN client.

Software

Blender.org

Textbook

There is no required textbook for this course. Freely available online websites and videos will be used for technical reference and training. All supplemental texts will be provided.

Digital files

Your “work” in this course is largely expressed as digital data. You should take every effort to prevent data loss. Keep a copy of your work on a cloud service like such as box.psu.edu. Ensure that you have multiple copies of your data at all times AND are saving iteratively (multiple scene files) as you progress. Data corruption happens often. Again, loss of data is not a valid excuse for submitting a project late.

Course Objectives

Upon completing the course each student will have:


  Learned the basics of 3D Animation, Modeling, and production and post-production.
  Completed technical/conceptual projects (assignments) as set out by the instructor, accompanied by an artist statement.
  Assessed projects in relation to the stated objectives of the assignment.
  Developed a language suitable for descriptive and critical understandings of their assignments and broader themes related to new media art.
  Participated actively in all group-discussions.


Avoiding Plagiarism

This course will require that you spend a lot of time searching for external learning resources including Youtube.com and Vimeo.com tutorials. Submitting work that you produce directly resulting from online tutorials for course projects is considered plagiarism. In addition, downloading and submitting free or paid 3D models and animations in place of satisfying exercise requirements is also considered plagiarism. For example, if an exercise asks you to create a 3D model of a character, but you instead download and submit it as your own work, you will fail the assignment, it will be noted in Penn State’s Starfish system, and additional disciplinary action may be taken.

Course Requirements

Attendance is mandatory; as this time will be used for critiques, reading discussions, presentations, video screenings, collaborative or group work, and the dissemination of general information. These sessions will at all times emphasize critical analysis and in­class discussion. In terms of studio production, whole class meetings may review work­in­progress; assess ongoing technical concerns; assist with immediate needs of a project concept and execution all the while continuing to develop a language appropriate for evaluation and critique. While there will be in­-class time to experiment and complete work, you will be required to spend many hours working outside of class­ time.

Course Prerequisites

DART 202, and enrollment in the Art BA, Art BFA, Art Education BS, Digital Arts and Media Design BDes or Photo BDes degree program.

Attendance Policy

Attendance is mandatory and professionalism both in and outside of class is a MUST. You are expected to participate in class discussions and critiques. Respect for others and class materials (cameras, decks etc) is expected. Students will be allowed three (3) absences without penalty. Any absences in excess of three (3) will result in a half letter grade reduction of the final grade for the course per absence. All absences will be counted. A student who will acquire absences due to a University sponsored activities must meet with me prior to the absences to make any special arrangements for missed work. A student who does not meet with me before the absences are incurred will be counted as absent. Any special medical or personal problems that occur, where absenteeism will exceed the allowed three may require course withdrawal or incomplete status on the final grade. Seven (7) absences mandates an automatic grade of F.

Grading

Unforeseen circumstances or changes in technology can influence how many exercises are assigned. Sometimes, changes mid-semester are made, but never at the detriment for a student’s ability to complete the assigned work.

Exercises

Approximately 6-7 exercises (~45% Total)

Projects

Approximately 2 projects (~45% Total)

Exam Policy

An integral aspect this class is viewing, discussing, and responding to your own work and the work of your peers. The group critique is at all times a comfortable and constructive environment designed for in-­depth analysis and evaluation. Through this process, each student will learn how to respond and challenge the formal (aesthetic), conceptual (idea) and interpretative (understanding) characteristics of any given artwork. Most importantly, the critique environment will push you to question and resolve your own artistic production. As with producing work, there are unlimited ways in which art can be approached and considered. If your assignment is not complete for the critique, your grade on that assignment will be lowered by one full letter for each class day it is late. You are required to attend critiques even if your work is not complete.

Academic Integrity

University Policies and Rules Guidelines states that academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University’s Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity, respect other students’ dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts. Academic integrity includes a commitment not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.

Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to acts such as cheating on exams or assignments; plagiarizing the words or ideas of another; fabricating information or citations; facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others; claiming authorship of work done by another person; submitting work completed in previous classes; and/or submitting the same work to multiple classes in which a student is enrolled simultaneously.

Diversity

Students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives are welcomed. The diversity that students bring to class is viewed as an asset and resource. This course aims to cultivate and maintain an equitable and culturally inclusive environment where students feel a sense of belonging. All students will be well-served, and students’ learning needs will be addressed both within and outside the classroom. Lectures, presentations, materials, and art-making and design activities will be mindful and respectful of diversity in all forms, including but not limited to ethnicity, race, culture, nationality, age, language, sex, (dis)ability, sexual orientation, gender, gender variance, religion, socioeconomic status, or veteran status. Student suggestions on how this course might better serve them personally or better serve underrepresented minoritized students are encouraged and appreciated.

COVID-19

ALL STUDENTS MUST wear a mask appropriately (i.e., covering both your mouth and nose) while you are indoors on campus. This is to protect your health and safety as well as the health and safety of your classmates, instructor, and the university community. Anyone attending class without a mask will be asked to put one on or leave. Instructors may end class if anyone present refuses to appropriately wear a mask for the duration of class. Students who refuse to wear masks appropriately may face disciplinary action for Code of Conduct violations. If you feel you cannot wear a mask during class, please speak with your adviser immediately about your options for altering your schedule.">

Description

Undergraduate Bulletin

Equipment and materials


  Given many students are learning remotely, a reliable and relatively well-spec’d computer is ideal for this course.
  Optional but recommended: Standalone digital tablet similar to the Wacom Intuos Pro for drawing and painting.
  Sketchbook


Accounts and access

Your PSU account allows you to access: box.psu.edu, lynda.psu.edu, canvas.psu.edu, and Zoom. You will also need to visit Google owned websites such as youtube and Google Drive. If you are in a country that doesn’t have have access to the free and open Internet, you can try using the Penn State VPN client.

Software

Blender.org

Textbook

There is no required textbook for this course. Freely available online websites and videos will be used for technical reference and training. All supplemental texts will be provided.

Digital files

Your “work” in this course is largely expressed as digital data. You should take every effort to prevent data loss. Keep a copy of your work on a cloud service like such as box.psu.edu. Ensure that you have multiple copies of your data at all times AND are saving iteratively (multiple scene files) as you progress. Data corruption happens often. Again, loss of data is not a valid excuse for submitting a project late.

Course Objectives

Upon completing the course each student will have:


  Learned the basics of 3D Animation, Modeling, and production and post-production.
  Completed technical/conceptual projects (assignments) as set out by the instructor, accompanied by an artist statement.
  Assessed projects in relation to the stated objectives of the assignment.
  Developed a language suitable for descriptive and critical understandings of their assignments and broader themes related to new media art.
  Participated actively in all group-discussions.


Avoiding Plagiarism

This course will require that you spend a lot of time searching for external learning resources including Youtube.com and Vimeo.com tutorials. Submitting work that you produce directly resulting from online tutorials for course projects is considered plagiarism. In addition, downloading and submitting free or paid 3D models and animations in place of satisfying exercise requirements is also considered plagiarism. For example, if an exercise asks you to create a 3D model of a character, but you instead download and submit it as your own work, you will fail the assignment, it will be noted in Penn State’s Starfish system, and additional disciplinary action may be taken.

Course Requirements

Attendance is mandatory; as this time will be used for critiques, reading discussions, presentations, video screenings, collaborative or group work, and the dissemination of general information. These sessions will at all times emphasize critical analysis and in­class discussion. In terms of studio production, whole class meetings may review work­in­progress; assess ongoing technical concerns; assist with immediate needs of a project concept and execution all the while continuing to develop a language appropriate for evaluation and critique. While there will be in­-class time to experiment and complete work, you will be required to spend many hours working outside of class­ time.

Course Prerequisites

DART 202, and enrollment in the Art BA, Art BFA, Art Education BS, Digital Arts and Media Design BDes or Photo BDes degree program.

Attendance Policy

Attendance is mandatory and professionalism both in and outside of class is a MUST. You are expected to participate in class discussions and critiques. Respect for others and class materials (cameras, decks etc) is expected. Students will be allowed three (3) absences without penalty. Any absences in excess of three (3) will result in a half letter grade reduction of the final grade for the course per absence. All absences will be counted. A student who will acquire absences due to a University sponsored activities must meet with me prior to the absences to make any special arrangements for missed work. A student who does not meet with me before the absences are incurred will be counted as absent. Any special medical or personal problems that occur, where absenteeism will exceed the allowed three may require course withdrawal or incomplete status on the final grade. Seven (7) absences mandates an automatic grade of F.

Grading

Unforeseen circumstances or changes in technology can influence how many exercises are assigned. Sometimes, changes mid-semester are made, but never at the detriment for a student’s ability to complete the assigned work.

Exercises

Approximately 6-7 exercises (~45% Total)

Projects

Approximately 2 projects (~45% Total)

Exam Policy

An integral aspect this class is viewing, discussing, and responding to your own work and the work of your peers. The group critique is at all times a comfortable and constructive environment designed for in-­depth analysis and evaluation. Through this process, each student will learn how to respond and challenge the formal (aesthetic), conceptual (idea) and interpretative (understanding) characteristics of any given artwork. Most importantly, the critique environment will push you to question and resolve your own artistic production. As with producing work, there are unlimited ways in which art can be approached and considered. If your assignment is not complete for the critique, your grade on that assignment will be lowered by one full letter for each class day it is late. You are required to attend critiques even if your work is not complete.

Academic Integrity

University Policies and Rules Guidelines states that academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University’s Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity, respect other students’ dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts. Academic integrity includes a commitment not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.

Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to acts such as cheating on exams or assignments; plagiarizing the words or ideas of another; fabricating information or citations; facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others; claiming authorship of work done by another person; submitting work completed in previous classes; and/or submitting the same work to multiple classes in which a student is enrolled simultaneously.

Disability Policy

Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational programs. Every Penn State campus has an office for students with disabilities. The Office for Disability Services (ODS) Web site provides contact information for every Penn State campus: http://equity.psu.edu/ods/dcl. For further information, please visit the Office for Disability Services Web site: http://equity.psu.edu/ods.

In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, you must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially enrolled, participate in an intake interview, and provide documentation:http://equity.psu.edu/ods/guidelines. If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campus’s disability services office will provide you with an accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early in your courses as possible. You must follow this process for every semester that you request accommodations.

<h3 id="accounts-and-access">Accounts and access</h3>

<p>Your PSU account allows you to access: box.psu.edu, lynda.psu.edu, canvas.psu.edu, and Zoom. You will also need to visit Google owned websites such as youtube and Google Drive. If you are in a country that doesn’t have have access to the free and open Internet, you can try using the <a href="https://www.work.psu.edu/access/vpn/beta.shtml">Penn State VPN</a> client.</p>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender.org</a></p>

<h3 id="textbook">Textbook</h3>

<p>There is no required textbook for this course. Freely available online websites and videos will be used for technical reference and training. All supplemental texts will be provided.</p>

<h4 id="digital-files">Digital files</h4>

<p>Your “work” in this course is largely expressed as digital data. You should take every effort to prevent data loss. Keep a copy of your work on a cloud service like such as box.psu.edu. Ensure that you have multiple copies of your data at all times AND are <strong>saving iteratively</strong> (multiple scene files) as you progress. Data corruption happens often. Again, loss of data is not a valid excuse for submitting a project late.</p>

<h3 id="course-objectives">Course Objectives</h3>

<p><strong>Upon completing the course each student will have:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Learned the basics of 3D Animation, Modeling, and production and post-production.</li>
  <li>Completed technical/conceptual projects (assignments) as set out by the instructor, accompanied by an artist statement.</li>
  <li>Assessed projects in relation to the stated objectives of the assignment.</li>
  <li>Developed a language suitable for descriptive and critical understandings of their assignments and broader themes related to new media art.</li>
  <li>Participated actively in all group-discussions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="avoiding-plagiarism">Avoiding Plagiarism</h3>

<p>This course will require that you spend a lot of time searching for external learning resources including Youtube.com and Vimeo.com tutorials. Submitting work that you produce directly resulting from online tutorials for course projects is considered plagiarism. In addition, downloading and submitting free or paid 3D models and animations in place of satisfying exercise requirements is also considered plagiarism. For example, if an exercise asks you to create a 3D model of a character, but you instead download and submit it as your own work, you will fail the assignment, it will be noted in Penn State’s Starfish system, and additional disciplinary action may be taken.</p>

<h3 id="course-requirements">Course Requirements</h3>

<p>Attendance is mandatory; as this time will be used for critiques, reading discussions, presentations, video screenings, collaborative or group work, and the dissemination of general information. These sessions will at all times emphasize critical analysis and in­class discussion. In terms of studio production, whole class meetings may review work­in­progress; assess ongoing technical concerns; assist with immediate needs of a project concept and execution all the while continuing to develop a language appropriate for evaluation and critique. While there will be in­-class time to experiment and complete work, you will be required to spend many hours working outside of class­ time.</p>

<h3 id="course-prerequisites">Course Prerequisites</h3>

<p>DART 202, and enrollment in the Art BA, Art BFA, Art Education BS, Digital Arts and Media Design BDes or Photo BDes degree program.</p>

<h3 id="attendance-policy">Attendance Policy</h3>

<p>Attendance is mandatory and professionalism both in and outside of class is a MUST. You are expected to participate in class discussions and critiques. Respect for others and class materials (cameras, decks etc) is expected. Students will be allowed three (3) absences without penalty. Any absences in excess of three (3) will result in a half letter grade reduction of the final grade for the course per absence. All absences will be counted. A student who will acquire absences due to a University sponsored activities must meet with me prior to the absences to make any special arrangements for missed work. A student who does not meet with me before the absences are incurred will be counted as absent. Any special medical or personal problems that occur, where absenteeism will exceed the allowed three may require course withdrawal or incomplete status on the final grade. Seven (7) absences mandates an automatic grade of F.</p>

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>

<p>Unforeseen circumstances or changes in technology can influence how many exercises are assigned. Sometimes, changes mid-semester are made, but never at the detriment for a student’s ability to complete the assigned work.</p>

<h3 id="exam-policy">Exam Policy</h3>

<p>An integral aspect this class is viewing, discussing, and responding to your own work and the work of your peers. The group critique is at all times a comfortable and constructive environment designed for in-­depth analysis and evaluation. Through this process, each student will learn how to respond and challenge the formal (aesthetic), conceptual (idea) and interpretative (understanding) characteristics of any given artwork. Most importantly, the critique environment will push you to question and resolve your own artistic production. As with producing work, there are unlimited ways in which art can be approached and considered. If your assignment is not complete for the critique, your grade on that assignment will be lowered by one full letter for each class day it is late. You are required to attend critiques even if your work is not complete.</p>

<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h3>
